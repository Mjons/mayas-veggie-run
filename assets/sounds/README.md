# Sound Effects Guide

The game will look for these sound files in this folder:

## Required Sound Files

1. **jump.wav** - Plays when Maya jumps
   - Suggested: Light, bouncy sound effect

2. **collect.wav** - Plays when collecting food (veggies)
   - Suggested: Pleasant chime or "yum" sound

3. **hit.wav** - Plays when hitting an obstacle (rock)
   - Suggested: Thud or "oof" sound

4. **love.wav** - Plays during the puppy hug moment
   - Suggested: Heart sound, cute jingle, or happy music

5. **game_over.wav** - Plays when energy reaches 0
   - Suggested: Sad trombone or game over jingle

6. **bgm.mp3** (optional) - Background music that loops
   - Suggested: Upbeat, cheerful instrumental music
   - Set to 30% volume automatically

## File Format Notes

- Use **.wav** format for sound effects (better for short sounds)
- Use **.mp3** or **.ogg** format for background music
- Keep sound files small (under 1MB each) for faster loading

## Where to Find Free Sounds

- **Freesound.org** - Community sound library
- **OpenGameArt.org** - Game asset library
- **Zapsplat.com** - Sound effects library
- **Incompetech.com** - Royalty-free music

## Important
